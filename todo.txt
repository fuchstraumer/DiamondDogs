GENERAL/BUGS:
- GUI goes transparent and all weird when alt is used to release mouse
- Limit framerate slightly
- Code cleanup and documentation for dated/legacy components:
    - Terrestrial.h, Star.h/Star.cpp (need updates due to changed code since last use)
    - Atmosphere.h/.cpp, Skybox.h/.cpp
    - Icosphere REALLY needs cleanup and maintenance
GUI:
- Add more statistics on rendering data
- Add controls for terrain data
RENDERER:
- Decrease required allocation count per object by sharing VkDeviceMemory objects between the buffers
  objects in things like the mesh class
- Possibly roll in base VkResource class or ref counting to better manage device objects?
- Find a way to utilize all available device queues
    IDEA: Ring buffer of queue handles, first queue is one that was used the longest time ago.
    End of ring buffer is most recently used queue handle.
- View frustum culling and a way to visualize the frustum
- Antialiasing or MSAA of any kind
- Implement rest of texture formats, i.e 2D arrays and clean up duplicate code in texture variants
TERRAIN: 
- Fix duplicated data between tiles - this is STILL a problem
- Implement pruning/clearing of unused terrain height tiles.
- Develop more terrain sampler sub-classes, implement terrain sampler as part of
  HeightNode system
AUDIO:
- Implement an actual audio subsystem. FMOD?
