/*
	
	GAS_GIANT_H

	Defines a gas giant object. uses an icosphere base mesh, and then uses procedural
	generation from there to create an interesting texture. A base atmospheric composition
	can be specified, from which the colors will be selected. This also affects the 
	rendering of the atmosphere.

	Ring systems are WIP but will eventually be added. Satellites can be added. 

	Clouds do not really move, currently. This will be changed eventually.
