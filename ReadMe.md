WIP as hell (as is the usual for me) rendering/engine project. After the fun I had creating Caelestis, I'm going to be creating a similar project not using plugins (instead sticking to static library "modules"). There are lots of difficulties and disadvantages in a plugin-driven system, and I want to compare the dev time required to reach a similar point using a more coventional method. Additionally, not using plugins will allow me to use the knowledge of template metaprogramming that I am beginning to acquire: something that's just not possible with DLLs.

Stay tuned, as I'm hoping to have some exciting stuff here soon!
